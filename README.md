# neurotech-hacking
​​
join us for a fun-filled day of discovery and creativity at the neurotech hacking event!

​​open to beginner or experienced BCI hackers, just bring your computer and your curiosity.

​​we'll kick off the day by a quick intro, followed by a casual chat about our goals for the event. then, we're jumping right into hacking on cool stuff using either:

1. ​you own a bci like Neurosity
2. ​you don't own a bci, we'll share some datasets with you or let you connect to one of our bci

​we'll wrap up the event with a demo session where everyone can show off their discoveries.

​​see u there!
